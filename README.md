# Feature Engineering in Action!

# Just wrapped up an exciting task as part of my data science internship, where I engineered new features from a restaurant dataset! 
# Key Highlights:
Restaurant Name & Address Length: Analyzing brand and location characteristics.
Service Availability: Encoded features like 'Table Booking' and 'Online Delivery.'
Franchise Detection: Identified popular chains to aid in market segmentation.
Price Analysis: Calculated average price per dish to understand pricing strategies.
This enhanced dataset is now primed for deeper analysis and predictive modeling! ðŸ’¡
